# **Can'tTouchTheseShapes:** _An Encapsulation Demonstration_
---
This program demonstrates the power of encapsulation. The purpose is to provide a means to interact with different Shape Classes without messing with their internal states. CantTouchTheseShapes contains the following:
1. **Program Class** 
    * _This program contains the Main Method and calls all classes_
2. **SafeConsoleInput Class**
    * _This asks the user for input, guards from errors using try-catch handlers, returns a double, and demonstrates the use of static methods_
3. **Circle Class**
    * _Provides Area, Circumference, and Radius. Allows for user interaction through the use of contructors and SetRadius_
4. **Triangle Class**
    * _Provides Area, Perimeter, Dimensions, and each Side Value. Allows for user interaction through the use of contructors, SetSideA, SetSideB, SetSideC, and SetDimensions_
5. **Rectangle Class**
    * _Provides Area, Perimeter, Length, Witdth, and Dimensions. Allows for user interaction through the use of contructors, SetLength, SetWidth, and SetDimensions_
6. **Square Class**
    * _Provides Area, Perimeter, and Side. Allows for user interaction through the use of contructors and SetSide_
